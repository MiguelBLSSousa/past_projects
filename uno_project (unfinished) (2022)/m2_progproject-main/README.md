GAME INSTRUCTIONS

WARNING: Sadly we did not have enough time to fully finish the game. It still has a lot of bugs, but the safest way to play is with only 2 clients. 
There is a local version of the game that we added on the local branch of our git reposotory. This version of the game has full functionality,
once the networking was added to the game, a lot of things went south.

ONLINE:

1. Run Server.java

The server will automatically run on localhost, you must then input the port number to open the server on.

2. Run Client.java

Once the server is up and running, you can open up as many clients as you would like to play in a game (we recommend 2 though, due to bugs).
You must then follow the instructions printed on the console.
When asked if you want to play a random game, if YES it will start a game with random computers, if NO, it will ask for the amount of players that
will join the game. 
After the number is entered, the server will wait for that number of clients to connect and join a game of the same amount of players and will then
automatically start the game!

OFFLINE:

1. Run Game.java

2. Follow instructions on the console
